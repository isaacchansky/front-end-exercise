Frontend Challenge for Developer Candidates
===========================================

To better assess a candidates development skills, we would like to provide the following exercise. This is intended to be an exercise that can be developed within a few hours.

Prerequisites (mandatory)
-------------------------

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

Prerequisites (optional)
------------------------
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

Installation
------------

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:massgov/front-end-exercise.git && cd front-end-exercise/
```

Set up your local server with the dependencies and / or task runners that you see fit for this project.  You can use any library/framework/plugin you want.

???? Please use some template library (http://handlebarsjs.com/, http://mustache.github.io/, ...).

Project description
-------------------

We want to develop a small checklist component, based on a [visual design spec](http://invision.com).

On page load, we'll display the checklist of items.

When the user selects a checkbox, the item should appear crossed out, as shown in the design.

When the user selects a checkbox, holds down the `SHIFT` key and selects a checkbox further down the list, every item in between should also be selected.

Bonus
-----

See if you can develop this component in a way that it (or pieces of it) could be reused elsewhere in our web app.

See if you can connect with an external data source to load the todo items and check / maintain the state of those items.

Evaluation
----------

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

* Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?
* Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?
* Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?
* Do you master your working environment?

Due to the limited time consider the followings:

* It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.
* We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome.
